# Fame is a bee

*By Emily Dickinson*

Fame is a bee.
It has a song --
It has a sting --
Ah, too, it has a wing.

# Fever – is composed of Nows

*By Elimy Dickinson*

Forever – is composed of Nows –
‘Tis not a different time –
Except for Infiniteness –
And Latitude of Home –

From this – experienced Here –
Remove the Dates – to These –
Let Months dissolve in further Months –
And Years – exhale in Years –

Without Debate – or Pause –
Or Celebrated Days –
No different Our Years would be
From Anno Dominies –
